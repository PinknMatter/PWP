# Particles With Personality

## Prompt; Avoiding conversation 
I wanted to make some interaction where the particles move away from the mouse (Avoid)
I struggled with adding some type of interation that describes conversation, I ended up changing the mouse to be one of the particles to elude that the particles were 
avoiding one of their own. I'm prety happy with the way it turned out, the code is short and concise and portrays my vision
